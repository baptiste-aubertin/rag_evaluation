So while train crashes are rare, surely it couldn't hurt to add seat belts? In fact, train seats are currently designed on the assumption that passengers are unrestrained, so they are intended to absorb the energy of impact during a crash. Modifying seating to add seat belts would increase the likelihood of injury for unrestrained passengers, since the seats would have to be made more rigid.

Here is a detailed explanation based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Safety and Accident Rates:** Trains are inherently very safe compared to road vehicles and airplanes. According to the context, car crashes are far more frequent than train accidents, and seat belts became popular in cars during a time when trains had already achieved a high safety standard. Additionally, the design of trains, including strong windows and robust seats, is engineered to prevent ejection and reduce injury during accidents, negating the need for seat belts.\n\n2. **Standing Passengers:** Trains often accommodate standing passengers, who would not benefit from seat belts. The context mentions that urban buses, which similarly allow standing passengers, also do not have seat belts. This reflects a practical design choice that ensures accessibility for all passengers.\n\n3. **Operational Efficiency:** Trains, especially those used in dense commuter routes, rely on short dwell times at stations to maintain schedules. Requiring passengers to fasten and unfasten seat belts would add to the dwell time, potentially causing delays. For instance, the Thameslink service in the UK has been optimized to minimize station stops, and seat belts could hinder this efficiency.\n\n4. **Effectiveness of Seat Belts:** Research indicates that adding seat belts to rail vehicles does not provide a significant safety benefit. The context cites an assessment suggesting that there is no safety advantage to adding seat belts, and compliance among passengers would likely be low due to the perceived minimal benefit.\n\n5. **Injury Prevention Concerns:** Making seats more rigid to accommodate seat belts could actually increase the likelihood of injury for unrestrained passengers. Moreover, in certain crash scenarios, unrestrained passengers might receive lesser injuries by being thrown clear.\n\n6. **Train Design and Infrastructure:** The design of rail infrastructure, such as tracks and signaling systems, significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. Trains move on a single dimension without the ability to steer, simplifying safety management compared to roads.\n\nIn summary, the absence of seat belts on trains is due to their already high safety standards, the presence of standing passengers, the need for efficient operation, and the findings that seat belts do not provide substantial additional safety benefits.", "top5docs": [{"text": "Trains in most countries have never had seatbelts.

Therefore, passports need to be sequenced and fed into the machine in batches, which is a process that cannot be done on-demand.\n   - Additionally, the process of decision-making and visa issuance can take several weeks. It would not be practical to leave the passport with the applicant during this period, as it would complicate the verification and issuance process.\n   - In some cases, applications are processed in different locations, such as applications from Morocco being decided in Croydon, London.

This block ensures that the hotel has sufficient funds available to cover any additional charges. In your case, the hotel blocked $5,000, likely accounting for both the cost of your stay and anticipated additional expenses.\n\n2. **Separate Transactions**: The issue you're encountering is due to the separate nature of the block (authorization) and the actual charge.

Last-minute rail tickets can be quite expensive, while flights can sometimes offer competitive prices even at short notice.\n\n4. **Privatization and Fragmentation**: The UK railway system is privatized, and multiple companies operate different segments.

Here are some key points from the provided sources:\n\n1. **Starting Conversations**: It is not impolite to start a conversation with someone at a Biergarten. Engage socially and talk with your neighbors.\n\n2. **Clinking Beer Mugs**: Clink beer mugs with others at your table. It’s important to often do this and look each other in the eyes while you do it. The traditional way to say cheers is \"Prost\".\n\n3. **Drinking Etiquette**: Don’t drink the last sip of stale beer. Instead, get a new glass. This ensures you enjoy fresh beer and avoid stale tastes.\n\n4. **Crowded Biergartens**: During peak hours, Biergartens can be very crowded. Arrive early or look for tables where people might be leaving soon. Be prepared for potential long waits.\n\n5. **Bringing Food**: You are allowed to bring your own food, but be mindful of the type of food. Homemade items like Brezeln (pretzels) and Obatzda (a cheese spread) are safe choices. Bringing Chinese noodles, for example, might be seen as inappropriate.\n\n6. **Seating Etiquette**: It’s acceptable to take seats at partially occupied tables with long benches, but always ask if others are waiting for more people. For small tables with chairs, it's more appropriate to wait for an open table. Stammtische (regulars' tables) are exceptions; you need an invitation to join these.\n\n7. **Service and Self-Serve**: Biergartens are typically self-service, but some tables might have tablecloths indicating a different service level. You can bring your own food and napkins, but do not order food delivery to the Biergarten.\n\n8. **Local Laws**: Biergartens must close by 11 PM, and they stop serving drinks by 10:30 PM.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can enjoy a more authentic and respectful experience at a German Biergarten.", "top5docs": [{"text": "Also it’s not impolite if someone starts conversation with you.

The visa refusal means that the admission officer does not believe you. In his or her opinion, you did not prove the above points. Sending the exact same application in a second (or third, etc.) time will not change his or her mind. Depending on what country you're applying to, your visa rejection letter may or may not include reasons for being rejected. We have many questions about visa refusals here on the site which may detail how to specifically address the deficiencies in your application. The reason for your rejection is important: it explains why the admission officer does not believe you to be a genuine visitor. By understanding what went wrong with your previous application(s), you will be better able to improve your circumstances accordingly. As a side note: the United States tends to give out a form letter that indicates you were refused under a very broad subsection of the law. However they inform of your rejection in person during the interview, during which point you should ask the officer for the specifics of the rejection. For more information about this situation in specific, consider referring to our questions about rejections under 214(b). The reasons for your rejection(s) are very important. If you do not address these reasons, you will simply be rejected again for the very same reason. Should I just reapply once again? What are my chances? Once you're in a serial refusals situation, you need to stop applying. Do not apply again. You're in a bad situation, and each subsequent application only makes it worse. Your chances are low and rapidly approach zero with each subsequent application. Applying over and over again makes you seem desperate. Desperation is bad: a legitimate visitor is usually not desperate to visit. This causes the admission officer to become suspicious of you, and start wondering if perhaps your intention is to come to work or live in the country. Suspicious admissions officers will be even stricter when evaluating an application, and your chances of getting rejected get much worse. Furthermore, if you apply too many times, it is possible to actually be banned for making \"frivolous\" applications. You'll usually know if this happens because it is usually communicated to you once the ban occurs. Once you get to this point, there is nothing to do but wait it out. (But while you're waiting, consider following the suggestions below to improve your personal circumstances.) Can I somehow address the previous refusals to avoid them being a burden on all future applications? Yes and no. A common question for visa applications is something along the lines of \"have you ever been refused a visa before?\" From now on, you will have to reply 'yes' to this question and any follow-up questions. The refusal may also cause you to become ineligible for certain visa waiver programs should you otherwise become eligible in the future. (For example, a US visa refusal causes you to be ineligible for the ESTA program.) And, finally, the best thing you can do at this point is to retain a lawyer who specializes in visa application issues. How to go about retaining such a lawyer depends highly on what country you're applying to -- for the UK, one would refer to the Law Society, for example -- but this is essential for your subsequent applications especially if you insist on applying again. What can I do to improve my odds in the future? How can I break the pattern? You need to accept the fact that you are simply not going to visit the country you have applied to right now. Some day in the future you may reapply, but at the moment, that door is closed. In the mean time, you should focus on: proving yourself to be a good visitor to other countries improving your ties to your home country maintaining a stable source of employment/income and saving your earnings judiciously By visiting other countries, following the rules, and leaving when you're supposed to, you are accumulating \"proof\" that you're a genuine visitor. In subsequent applications, admissions officers will see these previous trips and it will support your claim that you are only coming to visit and that you will leave when you are supposed to because you have done so before. This is a concept called a \"travel history.\" We have an excellent question on how to build up a travel history. But it boils down to travelling to developed western countries that have more lax travel requirements for your particular passport and/or country of citizenship. The second thing you need to do is build up your ties to your home country. A \"tie\" is something that an admissions officer will consider to be a reason you will go home after your trip is over. Some ties include: starting a family having a stable job with a steady salary or income owning property such as a home This is not an exhaustive list, and it is not intended to be a list of things you must do. But the point is that you need to show that you have good, strong reasons to return to your home country after your trip. Take this time to develop those. The third major thing you should be doing is improving your means. Admissions officers like to see stable employment and a steady income. Save what you make -- not necessarily all of it, but a portion of it -- and grow your bank balance. Spend your money wisely. It is important that your bank account reflect your monetary means. If you have none, open one. If you are paid in cash, deposit it as soon as you are paid and withdraw just what you need for living expenses. Keep your payslips or receipts as a record of where your money is coming from. If you own your own business or work in a family business, start drawing a salary (if you do not already) and keep the business accounts separate from your personal account. When you do apply for a visa again, you need to consider how much of these savings you will be spending on your trip. A genuine visitor is not going to spent 90% of his or her lifetime earnings for a one-week visit. Finally, you should take this time to review the reasons given in your refusal letters and to address those concerns"}], "answer": "Dealing with serial refusals of a visa can be a challenging and frustrating process. According to the provided context, here are some key steps and considerations to follow:\n\n1. **Stop Applying Immediately**: Once you are in a serial refusals situation, it is crucial to stop applying. Each subsequent application increases the suspicion and makes your future chances of success much lower. You should not apply again until you have addressed the root causes of your rejections.\n\n2. **Understand the Reasons for Rejection**: The reasons provided in your refusal letters are crucial. You need to understand these reasons thoroughly to address them properly. If the refusal letters do not specify reasons, you should review the common visa refusal questions available to identify potential issues.\n\n3. **Legal Advice**: Retaining a lawyer who specializes in visa applications is highly recommended. This professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances and can potentially help you in navigating the complex visa application process.\n\n4. **Improve Personal Circumstances**: While you wait, take this time to improve your personal circumstances. For instance, your financial situation should be documented clearly. Keep payslips and receipts as records of your income. If you own a business or work in a family business, ensure you are drawing a salary and keeping business accounts separate from personal ones. This will help demonstrate that you have strong ties to your home country and can support yourself financially.\n\n5. **Do Not Lie**: Honesty is critical in visa applications. Lying or exaggerating information can result in more severe consequences, including bans.\n\n6. **Avoid Appearing Desperate**: Frequent applications can make you appear desperate, which is a red flag for admission officers. They might suspect that your intention is to stay and work or live in the country, rather than visiting temporarily.\n\n7. **Address Previous Refusals**: You must truthfully disclose any previous refusals when applying again. Prepare to explain how you have addressed the issues that led to the refusals.\n\n8. **Consider Professional Help**: Consulting a visa specialist can provide you with detailed guidance and increase your chances of success once you are ready to apply again.\n\nIn summary, the key is to take a step back, understand the reasons for the refusals, and make genuine changes to your situation before attempting to apply again.", "top5docs": [{"text": "However they inform of your rejection in person during the interview, during which point you should ask the officer for the specifics of the\nrejection.

The Secretary of State can also deem deportation conducive to the public good.\n- **Examples:** EEA nationals can be deported following a criminal offence, and this constitutes most deportations.\n\n### Removal:\n- **Frequency:** Removal happens much more frequently. For example, almost every week, charter flights leave for destinations like Pakistan with around 40-50 passengers who have been served removal papers.\n- **Reasons for Removal:** Removal applies to non-citizens who have either entered the country illegally or deceptively, stayed beyond the permitted period of their visa, or violated the conditions of their leave to remain in the UK.\n- **Process:** Removal is typically handled through administrative means and does not involve the same level of judicial scrutiny as deportation.\n\nIn summary, deportation is a more severe legal process involving serious criminal convictions and judicial decisions, while removal is a more common administrative action dealing with various violations of immigration rules.", "top5docs": [{"text": "People will often mistakenly use deportation instead of removal.

If the frozen liquid item is partially melted, slushy, or has any liquid at the bottom of the container, it must meet the 3-1-1 liquids requirements.\n   - Additionally, any item that is not solid at room temperature, even if frozen, is still subject to the 100 ml rule. This means non-solid foods like yogurt, pudding, peanut butter, and jam must be in containers of 100 ml or less.\n\n2. **Medical Exceptions:**\n   - Medically necessary liquids may be accompanied by ice packs, but these must be declared to a security officer for inspection.\n   - Frozen perishables for medical reasons can be packed in carry-on or checked baggage using dry ice, but the FAA limits you to five pounds of dry ice that is properly packaged.\n\n3. **Australian Regulations:**\n   - In Australia, for a liquid, aerosol, or gel to be considered a solid, it must be solid at room temperature. Therefore, frozen liquids, which are liquid at room temperature, are still subject to the 100 ml rule.\n\n4. **European Union (EU) and United Kingdom Regulations:**\n   - Both the EU and the UK define liquids by their substance rather than their state (frozen or not).

For instance, Tennessee demands proof of residency, and Georgia requires a Georgia driver's license. According to one source, Virginia does not require a local driver's license, making it a good starting point for a road trip.\n   - Check the DMV.org or the specific state's DMV website for detailed requirements.\n\n2. **Purchase a Car**:\n   - You can find affordable cars that are likely to function well for the duration of your trip. Ensure the car is in acceptable condition for a road trip.\n   - The dealership will give you the title of the car after the purchase.\n\n3. **Register the Car**:\n   - Visit a DMV location to register the car. Bring the title and any required documents such as a driver's license or proof of address.\n   - In Virginia, you might be asked for a Social Security number or a Virginia driver's license, but it's not always mandatory.\n   - Pay the sales tax, which varies by state, typically around 4% in Virginia.\n\n4. **Obtain Insurance**:\n   - Insurance can be costly, especially if you are under 25 years old. However, it is cheaper than renting a car.\n   - Be aware that some insurance companies screen for short-term rental addresses, so using an Airbnb address requires caution.\n   - Expect to pay around $150/month for insurance.\n\n5. **Prepare for Your Trip**:\n   - Once registered and insured, you will receive a new title, license plates, and a proof of registration.\n   - With these documents, your driver's license, and proof of insurance, you are ready to go on your road trip.\n\n6. **Selling the Car**:\n   - To sell your car, ensure it meets the legal requirements of the state, such as a smog test if you are in California.\n   - The new title must be filled out when transferring ownership.\n\n7. **Time Management**:\n   - Buying a car, getting insurance, and registering can be completed in a day. For example, a car dealer might take around two hours, insurance around 40 minutes, and DMV registration around 20 minutes, assuming the DMV is not busy.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully purchase a car for a road trip in the United States, navigating the necessary legal and administrative procedures efficiently.\n\nReferences:\n- Source: group_3_EBxDn9E.md", "top5docs": [{"text": "Tourists can easily buy a car in the US for a road trip - registration and insurance are the tricky parts.

That's because most rental offices in mid-size and larger cities are corporate-owned, and all three of the big-name rental companies that operate the eight major brands (Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Alamo, National, Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty) now use a \"floating fleet\" model, which means that the companies maintain a nationwide single fleet and any car can be assigned to and rented from any location at any time. So if someone rents a car at Avis LAX and returns it at Avis in Austin, the car simply gets washed by the detailing crew at Avis Austin, placed in a parking stall at Avis Austin, and assigned to the next Avis Austin customer who comes in to pick up that size car. The same thing happens if they rent at Avis LAX and return at Avis in downtown Los Angeles or Avis in Midtown Manhattan or Avis at Chicago Midway airport. That's why a large number of license plates on any corporate-owned rental lot tend to be from out of state. Now, of course, for every person who picks up in LAX and returns elsewhere, there's usually someone renting elsewhere and returning in LAX, so the fleet tends to stay pretty balanced. That's why I say they charge the one-way fee \"because they can\"--because there really isn't a hard cost to them. Cars go out, cars come in, and all is good. But the market (supply, demand, and competition) allows them to charge a premium price for one-way rentals, so even though there's no (or a very minimal) direct expense associated with these kinds of one-way rentals, they do it because they can. Of course, sometimes one-way flows do result in an imbalanced fleet. If LAX loses too many cars and they have fewer cars than they forecast needing to meet demand, then they do have to arrange for cars to be brought back from somewhere else. So sometimes it is necessary to truck a load or ten of cars in from elsewhere, and that does have a cost, so collecting one-way fees allows them to cover those costs. It's worth mentioning that seasonal demand can have some interesting effects. I've taken advantage of the fall \"Florida Drive-In\" specials, where picking a car up in the Northeast and dropping it off in Florida can net some extremely attractive rates ($5-10 per day or so)--cheaper than a standard round-trip rental! This helps the rental car companies move cars from the colder northern states (where demand slacks off in the winter) to the warmer southern states (where winter is peak season). It's much cheaper to have people drive cars down for you than to pay a car carrier to haul it down by truck or, even worse, to have cars sit idle in the north while offices in the south buy or lease extra cars to meet demand. (There's also the related Florida Drive-Out special that takes place in the spring and some less-lucrative similar offerings out west.) So it's not always true that one-way rentals are more expensive! As well, there are certain places where one-way fees seem to be very reasonable or even not charged. One answer mentioned rentals in Germany--that's a place where one-way fees seem not to be part of the local rental culture, unless you try to drop the car off outside of Germany. Intra-Florida rentals are often quite cheap (due to a ton of competition--it's the largest rental car market in the world and there are literally dozens of rental car companies that operate at Florida's major airports), and intra-California one-ways are frequently not charged fees, too (that's because the one-way flows between places like Los Angeles and San Francisco are pretty balanced--as many people are interested in driving up Highway 1 as are interested in driving down Highway 1, I suppose), so that, combined with the high volume and competition, lends itself to reasonably-priced one-way rentals.

Here’s a breakdown of the key factors:\n\n1. **Inventory Management**: When a car is rented as a one-way rental, it needs to be returned to a different location than where it was picked up. This disrupts the carefully managed inventory balance at both the pickup and return locations. If one location is short on cars and another has a surplus, the rental company needs to reallocate vehicles to restore balance, often by paying to transport cars between locations. This additional logistics cost is factored into the one-way rental fee.\n\n2. **Market Competition**: In some regions, like Florida and California, there is a high level of competition among rental car companies. This competition can lead to lower prices for one-way rentals, making them more affordable. In Florida, for example, there are numerous rental car companies operating at major airports, leading to competitive pricing.\n\n3. **Seasonal Demand**: Seasonal demand can create special offers for one-way rentals. For instance, during the fall, there are Florida Drive-In specials where picking up a car in the Northeast and dropping it off in Florida can be extremely cost-effective, sometimes even cheaper than round-trip rentals. This helps rental car companies move cars efficiently from colder northern states to warmer southern states during peak winter seasons.\n\n4. **One-Way Fee Structures**: The structure of one-way fees can vary based on the duration of the rental. For short-term rentals, including the one-way fee in the daily rate might be more cost-effective. However, for longer rentals, breaking out the fee separately can be advantageous. For example, if you rent a car in Portland and drop it off in Seattle, the daily rate might balloon significantly, but if you can drive it back within a day, the included one-way fee is cheaper.\n\n5. **Regional Practices**: In some regions, like Germany, one-way fees are less common due to local rental culture. Similarly, within regions like Florida and California, balanced one-way flows reduce the need for additional fees, keeping one-way rentals reasonably priced.\n\nIn summary, the higher cost associated with one-way rentals primarily stems from the logistical complications and associated costs of managing inventory across different locations. However, regional competition and seasonal demand can influence pricing, sometimes making one-way rentals surprisingly affordable.", "top5docs": [{"text": "It’s worth mentioning that seasonal demand can have some interesting effects.

For instance: Historically, every time a new boiler was designed, the builder had to file a document called \"Form No. 4\". This documented every aspect of boiler design, and its safe operating pressures. Many locomotives would use that boiler design, and they all relied on the draftsman's Form No. 4. In heritage service, there was never a need for this form, because all locomotives had valid Form 4's at time of initial construction. After 1999, every steam locomotive required a BRAND NEW \"Form No. 4\" be developed based on that one locomotive's actual material condition. This was a deal-killer for many operations, either because of the cost of the survey, or the cost of repairs. As an example, a survey of Pennsylvania Railroad #1361's material condition found a design defect: a crown sheet inadvertently built near condemning limits the day it rolled out of the factory in 1918. What a piccadillo! The museum could either de-rate the engine, leaving it able to do little more than limp down a branch line dragging a few cars (not financially sustainable)... or engineer a new boiler with the faults corrected, so it could once again run mainline excursions. (the only viable business model for it). Museums prefer to respect historic fabric; most boilers are originals. The upshot of these regulations is that the number of steam locomotive operators plummeted: from 100 prior to the rulemaking, to a few dozen today. In effect, the rules meant \"Get BIG or get out\". So you have operators like Steamtown, Strasburg, Cass, Cumbres & Toltec fielding many steam locomotives, because they had a business model that would field the millions of dollars needed to be in the steam game. Also, the new regs limit number of operating days between major inspections - 1472 days with certain \"clock-stops\" allowed. This creates \"Tube time\" - the tubes are in the way of 1472-day inspections, and once they're out, you might as well replace with new). Thus, boilers effectively get an aviation \"C-check\" every 4-6 years. Operators must manage their \"tube time\" very carefully; i.e. stage work so running gear repairs are done before tube time starts ticking, and the engine isn't taken down during peak passenger season. Operator error is largely off the list Because of the dramatically smaller number of operators, operator training is far better than it was before. An accident as critical as a boiler explosion is as unlikely as another \"iodine pit\" or \"takeoff confusion\" accident - because the failure was so famous that everyone knows not to do that! The accident that \"brought the house down\" was with Gettysburg Railroad 1278. The boiler explosion occurred because of a wrong reading of how high the water was in the boiler. (a similar problem occurred at Three Mile Island a few miles away, and a week prior to that, in movieland in the movie The China Syndrome). In that case, bad practice had been passed down through the generations. The grandfather knew how to clear the \"sight glass\" of precipitate that might plug up the lines. The father didn't learn the lesson well, and taught the son wrong as well. Between them, they had allowed the sight-glass connecting piping to be entirely plugged, causing the gauge to read high. As you can imagine, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) inspects that closely today. By the way, the Canadian locomotive involved used an experimental method hoping to arrest boiler explosions. There are two methods to attach a staybolt to a crown sheet; the builder used both of them in alternating rows. A typical boiler explosion tears open a boiler's crown sheet in cascade failure, each row of staybolts failing in turn since they are about the same strength. The alternating rows stopped the cascade after a few rows, saving the crew's lives. Passengers were never endangered. As discussed, the regulatory blowback from this accident decimated the steam locomotive operations in the US, eliminating smaller operations - and the remaining fraternity of steam locomotive operators are safety-minded. You'll never see another improperly blown sight glass on a US railway. From here, let me address other aspects of safety, since our UK brethren have raised those issues. How the government regulates tourist railways In 1988 FRA was given broad jurisdiction over anything that runs on rails, and their \"authority to regulate extends to all areas of railroad safety\". 49 CFR 209 Appendix A, \"The Extent And Exercise of FRA's Safety Jurisdiction\". However Congress also told FRA not to crush heritage railways with excessive regulation. 49 USC 20103(f). FRA waives its authority in certain areas (e.g. \"insular\" railroads entirely on private property behind a fence). By doing so, they place the operation in the jurisdiction of that state's department that regulates amusement parks, which can be a \"wild ride\" for the operator, as the state is not experienced at regulating tourist railways. However, FRA always has \"Emergency Order\" authority on any railway, and inspects for that purpose, often simply riding as a passenger. 99% of the time, the mere threat of an E.O. will bring the railway into compliance. As such, they issue very few. Railroads \"on the general system of transport\" (freight or commuters ply their rails), face \"the full monty\" of FRA regulations, because of that. However their historic aspects get certain waivers due to the fact that heritage equipment is simply unable to meet noise, crashworthiness and emergency preparedness rules. 49 CFR 227, 238 and 239. Many operations are not insular, but are not in the General System. FRA waives the picayune, time-consuming detail requirements (49 CFR 2xx.3), and looks at the broad strokes: Do they have a practice in place? Is it reasonable for them? FRA also \"ratchets up\" the regulations based on operating speed. As such, almost all heritage operations willingly stay under 30 mph, and many stay under 15 mph"}, {"text": "Boiler explosions - even in older devices/industry/locomotives - have dramatically reduced over time, in part due to new safety developments and inspections.

And the same room in the same hotel will also be cheaper at some times of the year or could be offered at other prices through different channels. Twenty years ago there would be a kilometer charge for trains, one or two prices for hotel stays (e.g. high and low season), all printed in guidebooks and elsewhere, plus some “hidden” prices (e.g. for tour operators who would book and pay in advance and carry the risk of selling the room or not). Nowadays, the web allows a lot more flexibility and you will find different prices depending on how full the hotel really is, whether you can cancel or change your booking, etc. The basic fact is that whether you get the same service or whether it costs the same to the provider is simply not relevant to pricing, at least as long as they have some way to practice price discrimination without antagonizing the customer too much. Just saying “for you, it will cost double” depending on how a person looks is difficult (it does work that way on markets in some countries!) but an extra charge for an extra guest won't feel like a very bad deal and is easy to communicate and apply. I suspect there is no other reason behind this. Note that it often works the other way around as well. The lowest rate on a particular flight might very well be under the average per-passenger cost. Economically, it's the cost of an additional passenger (the “marginal” cost) that matters and when most of the costs are fixed, it can be very low. Once you have a plane flying from A to B or a hotel staffed and warmed-up, you need to fill it at the highest possible total price, cost per unit is not relevant anymore. Also, using an extra bed does cost something"}, {"text": "will cost more for more people: chocolates etc, cleaning, cooling, electricity, heating, ice, laundry, lighting, loo paper, maintenance, stationery, tea & coffee, toiletries, and water. At first I thought the logic might have been that the price for 1 or 2 occupants had been adjusted to meet market conditions (for example lowered for a time when general occupancy was expected to be low) and that rates for 3 and 4 occupants had been left unadjusted (might have been too much bother to keep updating for what was likely a rare requirement). However there is far more logic to the pricing than I would expect from hoteliers. The prices are essentially $46 +$24 per person. Just with a twist that 1 person is counted as 2 people. Where rooms are double it is normal to charge for two people. Any discount for single occupancy is likely as much a result of negotiating skills as any regular difference in price. If for instance the bed is a double then just as much changing and washing of linen is required for one as for two people. But if there are two beds to change and launder then there is more cost than for one, so it is fair to charge less for usage of one bed and more for usage of two. As pointed out by @Relaxed, market forces are at work. These however are not accurately quantifiable because it also takes time and effort (ie cost) to fine tune tariffs very frequently – and keep any selling agencies up to date. So prices at any one time may not appear to make much sense when compared with other time periods. Working back to how the numbers were calculated might go something like this: Annual Fixed cost (lease, permanent staff, insurance, fixtures etc) $xM or about $30/room/available night (say) Variable costs (electricity, water, laundry, toiletries etc) per night per resident say $20 Scale up the fixed rate to cover room-nights not rented, say to $40 Add a return (say ~15%) and when occupied this is $46 per night per room when let and $24 per occupant/night. Those hotels that charge a rate per room may do a similar calculation but simplify their tariff by selecting a little more than the rate for two people – in relative terms charging slightly more for couples but slightly less for 3s and 4s. Overall they may also be making some savings by such simplification. Based on the above the prices part of your question might be expressed as \"Is $20 per person per night a fair costing?\". In my view it is not, quite. Labour is probably a large element of it (cleaning, housekeeping, maintenance) and that is mostly per room (when occupied). Electricity/(part of) heating is likely mostly \"per room\" – but bedside lights and appliance use (eg personal computers) would not be. Water, loo paper, minor damage etc is likely 'per person'. Toiletries and towels etc may be either. However I think near enough equitable for the approximation to be justified. Combined into a per room rate the prices you mention might be something like $110/night, to recover the same amount from the same number of guests spread across rooms in the same way. But in that case some singles and couples could be expected to be put off. For them it would be a price hike of $16/night. So the occupancy rate would go down and the price have to increase beyond $110 to compensate for that. Whereupon even more potential guests may be discouraged! I think your questions with question marks have been answered but: Why do hotel booking sites ask for the number of people? Most hotels do charge per person. I tried a group that does not, for 1 double for 1, 2, 3 and 4 people and the price was the same for 1 and 2 and twice that for 3 and 4 (but the same as each other). I doubt many of the 'per night' hotels (in UK) offer family rooms. 3 and 4 above were for two rooms. This being one reason to ask for number of people. Does it matter how many I say? Yes. There is almost certainly an upper limit per room (if only for fire security reasons, as mentioned by @Shannon).

Additional guests can increase expenses related to laundry, water usage, and the consumption of amenities such as soap, shampoo, and breakfast (if included). More people in a room can lead to higher costs that the hotel needs to cover. For example, a hotel serving breakfast must ensure that food costs are covered by the rates charged. If not, the hotel may need to raise rates or discontinue amenities.\n\n2. **Safety and Emergency Preparedness**: Hotels are legally required to know the number of guests in each room for safety reasons, especially in emergencies. If there is a fire or other emergency, the hotel and emergency responders must know how many people are in the hotel to ensure everyone's safety. Not accurately reporting the number of people could lead to serious consequences if an emergency occurs and some guests are not accounted for.\n\n3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Hotels must adhere to fire safety regulations, which typically include limits on the number of people per room for fire safety reasons. For instance, if a guest room is listed as having two people but actually has six, a fire department might only be looking for two people, potentially endangering the others.\n\nRegarding whether it matters how many people you say:\n\n- **Accuracy Matters**: It is crucial to accurately report the number of guests. If you book a room for two people but bring a third, the hotel could respond in several ways, such as downgrading your room, charging you the walk-in rate, or even asking the extra person to find other accommodation.\n\n- **Potential Risks**: Not providing accurate information can lead to overbooking issues, where the hotel might not have enough rooms to accommodate all guests properly. This could affect other guests who have legitimate reservations and need the rooms they booked.\n\nIn summary, the number of people you specify when booking is important for both financial and safety reasons, and you should provide accurate information to avoid any complications during your stay.", "top5docs": [{"text": "But in that case some singles and couples could be expected to be put off.

It causes disgust and you are devaluing yourself. Flee. This causes an instinctive trigger and marks you as guilty. If they had no reason to arrest you, now they have one and resisting an officer may be an offense punishable with prison. Depending on country and jurisdiction they may have a valid reason to shoot at you (!). The only valid reason for that if you are really, really in trouble (you saw e.g. a murder committed by the police). The right behavior is, to complete the last action, withdrawal with a plausible reason for denial: You continue with whatever you are doing without visible interruption because you...ahem...did not notice him. You walk away or if you are moving in his direction, look for whatever may be interesting (women/cars/buildings) to break eye contact. It really helps if you are already in a car, driving, and the environment is noisy. But unfortunately it cannot be avoided mostly: You are surprised, you look at him, he is already in vicinity and he repeats with so much intensity So you cannot try to withdraw. So the next step is to avoid conflict. Look at him/her and get a first impression. How does he/she look at you ? Wary ? Disrespectful (especially if you are a woman) ? Posturing ? Or greedy/sizing you up (you will recognize this look very fast) ? Stay always calm and polite. You are like a British butler which cannot be disconcerted. You are addressing with him as \"Sir\" or \"Officer\", ideally with his rank if you can discern it (you can also ask for it with interest). Always ask at least for his name (it depends on culture what fits for police/military, in the Western countries it is the surname) and address him with it (The name is the most loved word for everyone). The strategy now depends on how the $authority behaves and how do you judge the situation. Remember: You as tourist have nothing personal with him/her, so there must be another reason. Honest mistake: He/she looks wary at you. Someone matching your description is searched. Someone else is accusing you as a scapegoat. Or you are in an environment where you do not belong and this marks you as suspicous. Strategy: Show your passport, give the (correct !) data, explain why are you here, give him the hotel number and address. Show that you respect the authority. This will normally suffice. Do not try to outsmart him with false names, he may be smarter than you and call you unexpectedly with the false name and see by the missing immediate reaction that you lied to him. Cash cow: He/she is seizing you up and have a greedy look on their face. They want to be bribed, so they will invent offenses for a \"fine\". This may sound repulsive, but remember that in many countries the wages for police and military are very low. In that case you are always acting with the leader COMPLETELY ALONE (never bribe with witnesses) and show your passport where you convieniently placed some reserve money (you know, there are always maut stations or things to pay). If he is interested, the money will vanish in his pocket and he leaves you alone. If not and you judged wrong, he has no reason to be miffed because you simply give him your passport for identification. If you do not want to pay, you can try several strategies. You can play the dumb and cooperative tourist who can only speak his mother tongue and tries his absolute best to discover what the police wants from him. This means speaking politely in your mother tongue, searching frantically in your word list, misunderstand the police (by mistake, of course) etc. etc. Many give up frustated because they want easy targets and are not prone to work for their cash. Another strategy working wonders in Third World countries is feigning that you accept to be detained because you are expecting and working towards a trial. Trials are very unpopular because they are long, cumbersome and the police must turn up which they like to avoid in certain circumstances. Unfortunately some police is going so far to plant a crime to blackmail you (drugs are very convienient for this purpose). In that case I see really no other option than paying them because you are really screwed in this case. Enemy: The disrespectful look. You are a $insertyourhatedgrouphere or it is believed that you are belonging to them. Your strategy must be to avoid confrontation because he will search for reasons to nail you and this will be much easier if he can isolate you. So look out for the community, ask for translators, ask other people to help or explain something to you. Gather witnesses. Appeal to hospitality. Be as visible as possible. Ask yourself what stereotypes the authority figure has in his mind and try to avoid and dispel them. Unfortunately it can happen that other people share the beliefs and are treating you aggressively. In that case the unfortunate option may be to lie and deny the allegations even if you really are a member of the group. But everything was futile now. You are detained. In that case the first address is your consulate or embassy to inform your country (and the family and friends). They could also provide addresses of lawyers. So insist repeatedly to contact your embassy. If you see a foreign witness during or after the detention, ask him to contact the embassy with your name.

Yes, there are golf lessons. Once again, I don't take lessons. Like with coaches, many golfers have been successful with or without golf lessons. Personally: If anything, I'll have a playing partner watch me for a few swings. When I think about my golf game too much, I suffer. As you grow into the game of golf, you will find out for yourself. EDIT: To add to my answer (based on iandotkelly's answer), play in groups. Regardless of the skill level of the rest of your group, you all go through the same frustrations. Also, it keeps you accountable (and motivated, I really like playing with other golfers), and you have other playing partners who can be your eyes and ears when you hit your tee shot. This is what makes golf such an inviting sport. How much should I really need to invest just to start playing at a reasonable level? NOTE: I am a huge advocate for getting tour-caliber golf balls and fitted golf clubs. If you are just starting out (and on a budget), I would find a set of hand-me down golf clubs and inexpensive golf balls"}, {"text": "the first thing you need is a set of clubs. I will echo iandotkelly; used clubs are the beginner's best friend. People get rid of clubs all the time, either because they bought new ones or because they've had enough and are giving up the game. Look for local garage sales, check bulletin boards at local public courses, take a look at the 'List or the 'Bay, and check the \"pre-owned\" racks at local golf stores (Golfsmith deals heavily in used clubs from trade-ins at local stores). Judging by what I've seen, you should be able to put together a good set of clubs with bag for about $300 if you buy used clubs from a retailer. If you luck out at a garage sale or Craigslist listing, you could walk away with a full set of nice clubs for $25-$50 if the guy just wants to be rid of them. Contrasting that, buying a full set in a bag from a reputable brand like Adams or Macgregor will start at $500, and buying new components separately (driver, woods, iron set, wedges and putter) can easily run you over a grand. Don't do that until you know what you want in a set of clubs to fit your game (and are rich/interested enough to justify it). When assembling your clubs, the minimum you will want is a driver, 3-wood, a numbered iron set (typically from 3 or 4 through pitching wedge), a sand wedge and a putter. That's 11 to 12 clubs and will allow you to play from pretty much any lie. Once you identify the types of clubs you use best, or situations in which you don't have a good club for the job, you can add two or three clubs and look at replacing clubs in order to play to your strengths or fill in the gaps. Common additions are a 5-wood, for fairway shots where you'd normally use a hard-to-hit long iron; hybrids to replace long irons; and additional wedges to dial in the right distance in your short game. Things to look for in your first set of clubs: Cavity-back irons. These irons will remove material from the middle of the clubhead, and instead place most of it low and rearward, and the rest around the perimeter of the clubhead. This design is favored by the casual player because it is more forgiving of slight mis-hits (it can be said to have a larger \"sweet spot\"). Ten to fifteen years ago, these designs were brand new and the used market was full of the older, less forgiving \"muscle-back\" designs as golfers traded up. Now, these cavity designs are plentiful in the secondhand market, and honestly, this was the last real quantum leap in clubhead design, so you won't lose much technology-wise going used. Regular flex on graphite shafts. The used market is littered with clubs bought by people who thought the club made the golfer, and so went for stiff-shaft, 9.5*-loft drivers because that's the club their favorite tour pro uses, then got rid of it because they could only hit 200-yard worm-burners. The majority of golfers will get the best performance out of a 10.5*, regular-flex driver configuration, and regular flexes on any other graphite shafts in their club set (virtually all woods have graphite shafts; they're also common on hybrids. Graphite vs steel on the long irons is a personal preference, but virtually all short irons and wedges are steel-shafted for consistency). These configurations, because they do work well for the average golfer, are rarer than the outliers on used racks, but you can usually find a few good candidates. A slight draw bias on the driver. Again, a lot of players want the best and so they buy a driver labelled \"tour\" because they think they're getting the best quality. What they don't realize is that a Tour driver has either no bias, or a slight fade bias to correct for clubhead torquing with their stronger swing. In the hands of a casual golfer, a driver like this will probably push-slice uncontrollably. Most golfers, again, benefit from using a \"game improvement\" driver (typically marketed as just a regular driver), which has a slight 1-2* bias toward closing the face of the club, to compensate for the natural tendency to open the clubface when you just \"grip it and rip it\". However, avoid \"max game improvement\" or \"draw\" drivers; these have an extreme draw bias, up to 5* towards closed, and are intended for people who just can't stop slicing their driver and are unable or unwilling to change their swing. Learn how to swing a \"regular\" driver straight, and you'll minimize bad habits. A good putter. If there's one club that you should buy new for your first set, it's your putter. The pros drive for show, but putt for dough; putting is a high-precision, high-finesse aspect of golf, and it's where you make or break pars and birdies. So, you'll want a putter that feels good in your hands, that you can swing with the proper tempo and in line. Good, late-model used putters don't tend to hit the racks as often as other clubs (players will take their time looking for the right putter, and will stick with it for a very long time), and when they do they're snapped up quickly, but keep an eye out. There are dozens of designs of putter, all varying subtly in weight distribution, hosel/shaft positioning, visual cues, etc which can make one putter better than another for you. Learning to putt well is frustrating as it is; the last thing you want to do is have to compensate for a putter that feels \"wrong\", or is out of alignment. Any inaccuracy in putting should be all you, so you know what to fix. You will likely also want a glove for your \"leading hand\"; whichever hand is closer to the butt end of the grip (for a right-hander this will be your left hand). This glove will allow you to get a better grip on the club and will avoid blisters. Lastly, you'll want comfortable clothing that doesn't restrict movement. Golf attire is traditionally unfashionable, and even modern stuff can sometimes be a little out there, but there's good stuff too; while you can buy specialized clothing, all you really need is a polo shirt and a pair of casual-wear khaki shorts or slacks (not dress slacks) that fit you well and allow free range of motion. A lot of brands are touting \"moisture-wicking synthetics\" for athletic wear that breathe well and keep you dry, but I know plenty of players that swear by a good ol' 100% cotton polo. Your choice; down here in Texas, hot is hot, and color is more important than fabric. Once you have the equipment, you'll probably want a lesson. Check your local driving ranges for a \"group lesson\", or if you have some money to spend, get a private lesson. If you have absolutely zero money, or just want to try learning yourself, there are many online resources from Youtube vids to blog posts about everything having to do with the golf swing. As much as the pros say it's an easy, natural movement, the golf swing is a very complex motion, and as golf is a precision sport, small changes can have big impacts. Having a coach look at your own individual swing and correct the things you're doing wrong will help you, but you may just want to go out and hit a bucket before calling in the coach, so you can get a feel for your new clubs. Before you hit the links, you should be able to hit every club in your bag straight enough that people on the path won't be cowering behind their carts, and consistently enough that you can predict where it will fly and compensate for any inherent push, pull, draw or fade in the flight path of your ball. You should also be making good contact with the ball with every swing (no whiffs, tops, thin or fat shots). This will allow you to put the ball where you want it on the course and avoid the 20-yard walk of shame from the tee box after topping your drive. And don't forget your putter; remember that par is based on 2 putts, for good reason, and so for a typical par-72 course, fully half of those strokes will be putts if you know what you're doing. Lots of driving ranges and courses have chipping and putting greens, but you may have to pay more to use them. A game or three of miniature golf can help with getting a good putting line, but it can also hurt; miniature golf uses artificial turf and artificial terrain slopes, which generally make for \"fast\" putts and relatively easy-to-read shots; a real putting green will have less even grass, a \"grain\" inherent in the way the grass grows, and a slope (and natural variations thereof) to its surface which will make putts break, and a good short-game player must learn to read these elements and adjust their putting line. If you watch the pros play, you'll notice their secret; putt with exactly the strength needed to get to the hole, so that if you don't put it in the hole it's right there for the tap-in instead of a \"knee-knocker\" (close enough that you're expected to hole it, but far enough to miss). Practice doing this; putt towards the hole from varying distances, and work on getting the ball within a foot of the cup (if it goes in from 10 feet, great; if it doesn't you have an easy second putt). There are many techniques for getting the proper putting power; the two most common are a pendulum swing (vary the backswing by the amount of power you need, and then simply relax and let the putter fall through the arc) and a \"power putt\" (take a short backswing, then add the proper power from your trailing hand into and through the ball). These both take a lot of practice. You will also want the following for a round of 18 holes of real golf: Realistic expectations - Even if you hit relatively consistently and accurately at the range, you should not expect to par every hole, or even to bogey every hole. My very first round was a 116, and we weren't counting most of the penalty strokes I should have gotten. First-timer strict-rules scores of over 200 are not unheard of (though most casual players will stop counting by strict rules after the third quintuple-bogey in a row). On a real course, the ground is uneven, the grass is of varying length, the ground is harder and softer, your surroundings and visual cues will change with every shot, you'll have to accurately judge distances without the aid of those flags and signs out on the range (depending on the course you may not even be able to see the pin from your approach shot), and there's water, sand, leaves, stones, trees, bushes, high grass, and all manner of other things that will make pretty much every shot (including tee shots) less than ideal. You WILL score terribly your first time out no matter how you're counting. If you don't like the score, don't turn in the card. A sense of humor - As Leslie Nielsen said, the reason they call it \"golf\" is because all the other four-letter words were taken. This goes right along with the previous point; you WILL whiff a tee shot or two, you WILL watch a tee or fairway wood shot soar off to the right into somebody's backyard, you WILL pop the ball straight up in a sand trap and watch it plop right back down, and in general you WILL make shots you'd rather forget. Better to laugh them off with the rest of your group than to get frustrated and make more bad shots.

NFL teams are very large, with 53 players active of whom 46 play on any given Sunday, and every single one is typically utilized except perhaps a backup QB - compared to a baseball team (25, of which 12 or so play most days), hockey team (25), or basketball team (15, of which many teams use single digits in most games). Assuming a true minor league existed - where the game was played the same as it is at the pro level, which is fairly important for the minor league to have value - you'd need similar roster sizes, certainly at least 40 per squad; that would cost a lot of salary. Football also is the most dangerous of sports, which means it would have substantially higher expenses for doctors and health insurance; it also probably would need to pay players significantly more (minor league baseball players make very little, so a minor league team is pretty cheap - lots of players who have no shot at the majors, just filling spots, at $30k a year). If it were a true minor league, with nearly NFL size players (so 280-300 lb offensive and defensive linemen, etc.) you'd need to pay people appropriately. Semipro football is a thing and people certainly enjoy playing it for very little or no money, but they're not playing at the intensity and with players of the size of NFL players. You wouldn't be able to get away paying people peanuts. The current Arena Football League, which is not really a minor league - the size isn't comparable - pays about $15k in salaries per player; but the talent level isn't nearly the NFL level that it would need to be. The earlier Arena league, which did have close enough to NFL talent that it had some elements of a minor league system (ie, it wasn't uncommon for good Arena players to go to the NFL), paid much more - 31k minimum, 80k average. They also went bankrupt quickly. The current one is doing better, but even now isn't entirely financially sound - and that's with a lower quality of player at the lower salary level. The CFL pays about 80,000 a year, which is probably the only league that can truly claim to be sufficient quality that it could fill in as a minor league system directly. The NFL does have the practice squad, which serves some of the purposes of a minor league team (ie, some talent that they work with regularly to learn the systems, and can call up to the main team when someone gets hurt). I imagine the size of that squad (8 players) is well defined by the actual needs of teams - if everyone needed more, they'd increase that size. All of this is notwithstanding the fact that there have been multiple attempts to sell smaller leagues as NFL minor leagues. The USFL tried in 2012, now the FXFL is giving it a shot... who knows what will happen, but I suspect the same as in the past: a few years of failure followed by league closure. College football and NFL football just are too successful right now at chasing viewers to lose out to a new minor league. The major attraction of minor league baseball is watching professional baseball in your home town - and colleges provide that for football"}, {"text": "Money. If the NFL wants a farm system and there is a good chance they will in the future they will end up footing the bill for a lot of the infrastructure/costs. I have had offers to play in an older version of arena football and that included a per diem and $250 a game. I am not sure most current arena league players get paid more than 20-30K a year if that. So the choice was easy for me, stay at my tech job. So right away to get a higher quality player the league will have to be able to pay players something more than minimum wage. Also note that since almost all good players will opt to go to college right now (this could change) for football experience, that your player pool is 22-30 year old. If I was 19 and was offered an arena league spot I would have taken a pack of gum. At 24 with a real job there are ramifications to quit your job (to make practices) to make almost nothing. Baseball and hockey have a lot of teens and very early 20s in their pool. While football might have these ages too, the best out of this group will play at Alabama or Ohio St. A small football team (11 on 11) would need at least 35 players to function. This is usually the case in semi-pro leagues I have been involved in - which are nothing but regional clubs that play each other. There are several leagues like this in the midwest. There are \"tryouts\" but usually anyone is accepted at a practice given they don't get in the way. Some teams just need warm bodies for a scrimmage. And then a coaching staff for football is usually a lot bigger than other sports. You would have at least a head coach, 2 assistants, and trainer on staff. This is the bare minimum. The only sport that comes close to football as for equipment costs is hockey. With the concussion issues I have seen equipment prices go up 3-4 fold for organizations the past few years.

However, football is unique in this regard, and the reasons why it lacks a comparable farm league are multifaceted:\n\n1. **Career Length and Cost**: According to the context provided from \"group_4_8MrN3UF.md,\" football careers are the shortest among major American sports, and running a football team is the most expensive. NFL teams have large rosters with significant financial commitments to players, coaches, and medical staff. Establishing a minor league system would entail substantial additional costs, especially given the high medical expenses associated with the sport's physical demands.\n\n2. **Roster Size**: Football teams require a larger number of players compared to other sports. As noted, NFL teams typically have 53 active players, with 46 playing on game day. This sizeable roster requirement implies that a minor league system would also need to maintain comparably large teams, further increasing costs.\n\n3. **Players' Career Paths**: Many talented football players choose to attend college to develop their skills and gain recognition before entering the NFL. As indicated in \"group_5_KxXRLA9.md,\" fans pay significant attention to college football, making players recognizable stars even before the NFL draft. This college pathway can be seen as an effective substitute for a minor league system.\n\n4. **Financial Viability**: The context from \"group_4_8MrN3UF.md\" also mentions that current lower-tier football leagues, like arena football, pay players significantly less than minimum wage. For a farm league to attract talented players, it would need to offer better compensation, which could be financially unsustainable.\n\n5. **Professional Development Model**: The NFL relies on college football to develop players, much like a farm system. However, unlike European football academies, where players are trained specifically for a club's system, NFL teams must adapt to the varied styles and training methods used in different college programs.\n\nIn summary, the combination of high costs, the extensive player development through college football, and the financial models of existing lower-tier leagues contribute to why American football does not have a comparable farm league system, unlike sports such as baseball, hockey, and basketball.", "top5docs": [{"text": "Of all college sports in the United States, football is the one that most resembles a professional league.

This layer acts as partial insulation, preventing the heating element from effectively transferring heat to the rest of the milk. As a result, the heating element can overheat beyond its designed temperature range. \n\n2. **Overheating Electronics**: Kettles are typically designed to heat water up to 100°C (the boiling point of water), with a heat sensor immersed in the water to prevent overheating. However, when milk forms a char layer, it can cause the heating element to reach much higher temperatures, potentially leading to damage to the electronic components due to overheating.\n\n3. **Heating Element Damage**: The overheating can also cause the heating element to bend or warp out of shape, which can disrupt its connection to the electronic components. In extreme cases, plastic kettles can even melt.\n\n4. **Thermal Fuse Tripping**: Some kettles have a thermal fuse that acts like a heat-based fuse. When the heating element reaches a certain high temperature (typically around 190°C), the fuse is tripped, cutting off power to the heating element. If the thermal fuse trips frequently, it can lead to malfunction or damage.\n\n5. **Inability to Detect Empty State**: The context mentions that kettles might break similarly to when they are run empty. In both cases, the heating element can get extremely hot without the heat sensor detecting the issue because the sensor is immersed in the liquid, which is not present or is insulated by char in the case of milk boiling.\n\nIn summary, boiling milk in an electric kettle can break it due to the char layer leading to overheating, which can damage electronic components, warp the heating element, or trip the thermal fuse.

Introduction. Someone wrote a question on Seasoned advice about coconut based ganache and we got curious. Background. We love ganache even more than pure chocolate, and make it often ourselves, so we think we have all the prerequisites needed to create and judge a coconut based ganache recipe. Our favorite ganache recipe 1 (which we used as a starting point) is: 100 g chocolate, 72% cocoa (only made from cocoa, sugar, and cocoa butter, no vegetable fat or emulsifiers); 100 g cream, at least 30% (non-UHT), 25 g butter. Method. We prepared the base mix as follows: 25 g coconut milk were heated until boiling. They were removed from the heat. 25 g chocolate (72%) and 6g cocoa butter were added. Everything was left to dissolve. After 5 minutes, the mixture was whipped with a handheld mixer at the second-to-highest setting. This was Version 0. It was divided in two batches. Different versions were made from each batch by gradually adding guar (a knife-point-ful), egg yolk (1, in lieu of lecithine) and sugar (8g per batch). Each version was whipped for at least 3 minutes. The final versions (1c and 2b) where put for 30 min in the refrigerator, then taken out and whipped again. As there were no observable changes after the cold whipping, we do not treat them as a different version. We also made a small portion of dairy ganache for comparison purposes. Results.

Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n1. **Experimentation with Coconut Cream:**\n   - Group 5's experiments (context from group_5_KxXRLA9.md) show that coconut cream can be whipped into a ganache-like consistency. However, it requires additional stabilization methods, such as using xanthan gum, gelatin, or possibly carrageenan.\n   - Gelatin was used as an initial stabilizer, and it was noted that carrageenan might be a better long-term solution due to its higher melting point.\n\n2. **Whipping and Aeration Challenges:**\n   - Unlike dairy ganache, whipping coconut milk-based ganache does not result in significant aeration. This means the texture and structure are different from traditional whipped ganache.\n   - Coconut cream is considered too heavy and thick for achieving a light whipped ganache.\n\n3. **Stabilization Techniques:**\n   - Adding gelatin and xanthan gum together can help achieve a whipped and set consistency.\n   - Some modifications such as adding cocoa butter and stabilizing with thickening agents like guar gum can improve texture.\n\n4. **Comparison to Dairy Ganache:**\n   - A dairy ganache was made for comparative purposes. Coconut milk-based ganache, while possible, does not have the same texture and mouthfeel as dairy-based ganache.\n   - Coconut milk ganache can taste fattier and be runnier compared to dairy-based alternatives.\n\n5. **Other Ingredients:**\n   - The addition of sugar can affect the taste and texture. It is advised that if sweetness is preferred, it should be added before the thickening agent, such as guar gum, and a sweeter chocolate (50%) can be used instead of a bitter one (70%).\n\nOverall, while coconut cream can be used to create a non-dairy ganache, it requires careful stabilization and may not perfectly replicate the texture and mouthfeel of dairy ganache.", "top5docs": [{"text": "Verdict: The whipped cream charger was the missing link; along with some xanthan gum, it’s enough to get this goo whipped.

Alkaline conditions, concentrated solutions of carbohydrates and amino acids, and prolonged cooking times can all generate Maillard colors and aromas in moist foods. For example, alkaline egg whites, rich in protein, with a trace of glucose, but 90% water, will become tan-colored when simmered for 12 hours. The base liquid for brewing beer, a water extract of barley malt that contains reactive sugars and amino acids from the germinated grains, deepens in color and flavor with several hours of boiling. Watery meat or chicken stock will do the same as it's boiled down to make a concentrated demiglace. Persimmon pudding turns nearly black thanks to its combination of reactive glucose, alkaline baking soda, and hours of cooking; balsamic vinegar turns nearly black over the course of years!

Enameled cookware, on the other hand, is about as non-stick as stainless steel, i.e. not at all non-stick. This means that many frying applications prefer seasoned cast iron over enameled, where getting a smooth release from the pan is important to the dish. For example, I'd much rather fry eggs in seasoned cast iron than enameled. Setup & initial seasoning Enameled cast iron is ready to go right out of the box; give it a rinse to remove the dust of storage and travel beforehand, but otherwise it's usable as is. For bare cast iron, and even the pre-seasoned stuff you often find nowadays, it's wise to put a couple layers of your own seasoning on it before cooking anything. This process has been described in many other places, so I won't repeat it here, but it involves washing off any protective coating from the factory before spreading a very thin layer of fat or oil over the entire surface of the pan before bringing it up to a high temperature on the stove or, for evenness, in the oven. Some people recommend flaxseed oil, but I would steer you away from it; the resultant seasoning has a tendency to flake off. Any fat with a high smoke point should do: vegetable, peanut, canola, coconut, even (relatively pure) lard. Washing & storage Seasoned cast iron has a reputation for fussy maintenance, and while it does take more respect and diligence than most pan materials and coatings, it's not as bad as it's sometimes made out to be. Maintaining seasoned cast iron involves not letting it stay wet after washing, avoiding particularly harsh detergents or abrasives in the washing process and, if it's not getting enough incidental seasoning from regular use, periodic manual re-seasoning. Meanwhile, enameled cast iron is coated in a layer of what is effectively glass, and it could not care less about your detergents or being allowed to air-dry. Scrubbing with literal steel wool might be a bit much, but anything you'd do to anything made of glass in the sink should be safe for enamel. Reactivity Some folks warn against using seasoned cast iron for acidic foods for the same reason they warn against aluminium; the acid in, say a tomato sauce, or Filipino adobo, can leach metal out of the pan and into the sauce. In iron, at least, this can be either good or bad for you, depending on your iron levels otherwise - nutrition isn't on topic here, so speak to a doctor if you're concerned. A heavier layer of seasoning, less liquid foods, and less acidic foods are all ways to minimise this effect. Enameled cookware, meanwhile, is still covered in a layer of nonreactive glass, and won't exchange anything but heat with the food you're cooking. High heat Cast iron is often held to be an ideal material for searing food in; its respectable specific heat capacity and very high mass give it an enormous amount of thermal mass, meaning the temperature of the pan won't drop too sharply when food is added, and giving it time to pre-heat for searing can even out the hot-spots caused by its middling-to-poor conductivity. Of the two varieties of cast iron in this question, seasoned can take a somewhat higher temperature that enameled; while it is possible to burn off the seasoning layer, it takes a higher heat than damaging the finish on an enameled pan. This isn't a huge difference, but it does exist. One thing to note is that if your pan or pot has plastic or other non-heat-proof handles, removing these can leave you with a pan usable in a much hotter oven. Indeed, some companies manufacture and sell heat-proof knobs and handles for their products to replace the default ones. Overall, while both varieties can be used quite well for both frying and stewing operations, the properties of seasoned cast iron lean it towards those frying and searing applications"}], "answer": "Based on the provided context, seasoned cast iron offers several advantages over enameled cast iron:\n\n1. **Non-stick Properties**: Properly seasoned cast iron has a relatively good non-stick finish. While it may not be as smooth as Teflon, it is significantly more durable. The seasoning layer is harder to scratch off and can withstand higher temperatures without breaking down, unlike the Teflon coating which can release toxic compounds at high temperatures. Therefore, seasoned cast iron is better suited for applications where non-stick performance is crucial, such as frying eggs.\n\n2. **Heat Resistance**: Seasoned cast iron can handle higher temperatures than enameled cast iron. Although both types can be damaged by excessive heat, seasoned cast iron can withstand higher temperatures before the seasoning layer burns off compared to the point at which the enamel finish would be damaged. This advantage makes seasoned cast iron a better choice for searing and high-heat cooking applications.\n\n3. **Cooking Applications**: Seasoned cast iron is particularly well-suited for frying and searing due to its thermal properties. Its high specific heat capacity and mass allow it to maintain its temperature well when food is added, minimizing temperature drops. This characteristic is particularly beneficial for searing because it can even out the hot spots caused by the material’s average conductivity.\n\n4. **Reactivity**: While some concern exists about acidic foods reacting with seasoned cast iron and potentially leaching iron into the food, this can be mitigated by using a heavier layer of seasoning, reducing liquid content, or cooking less acidic foods. This effect is generally not a concern with enameled cast iron, which is covered in a non-reactive glass layer.\n\n5. **Maintenance**: Although seasoned cast iron requires careful maintenance to prevent rust and maintain the seasoning, it is not as difficult as is sometimes believed. Proper care involves avoiding prolonged wetness, using gentle detergents, and re-seasoning periodically if necessary. In contrast, enameled cast iron is simpler to clean and maintain, as it is effectively coated in glass and can withstand harsh detergents and air drying.\n\nIn summary, seasoned cast iron excels in non-stick performance, high-heat applications, and has a thermal profile ideal for searing and frying, making it a versatile tool for the kitchen, especially for tasks requiring high temperatures and non-stick surfaces.", "top5docs": [{"text": "Cast iron itself is very reactive and tends to rust easily, which is why it is seasoned or enameled to protect the metal with a coating of either\npolymerised fat or fused glass, and these two processes lead to a number of differences: Non-stick properties Properly seasoned cast iron has a quite\ngood non-stick finish - it won’t be as smooth as a Teflon pan, but at the same time, the seasoning is much harder to scratch off and can be safely\nbrought to searing temperatures that would cause the Teflon to begin breaking down and releasing toxic compounds.

On the other hand, Russian pirozhki are usually fried (but sometimes baked) buns stuffed with similar fillings. The primary difference is that pirozhki are based on a yeast dough and are egg-washed, whereas pierogi are unleavened. Complicating matters, Russian/Soviet cuisine has a separate name for what the Polish call pierogi, namely varenyky (вареники). This word is derived from a root meaning \"to cook\" or \"boil\", emphasizing the fact that varenyky are usually boiled while pirozhki are fried. Turkish Yufka and Bulgarian (also Bosnian) юфка (yufka) Originally, the word yufka comes from Turkey. It is an unleavened flatbread, rather dry and crispy. In Bulgaria, юфка is a type of pasta prepared by sun-drying paper-thin phyllo dough until it cracks and falls apart, and boiling the resulting pieces. The name can also (rarely) refer to the non-dried phyllo sheets used for baking. Italian maccheroni, Enghish and other languages macaroni and French (also English and other languages) macaron Macaroni, the English spelling of the Italian word maccheroni, is an umbrella term for hardwheat noodles produced through extruding through a machine, rather than rolling and cutting the dough. In some countries (e.g. The Netherlands, cf. this episode of an investigative TV show about food), though, the term 'macaroni' is used to indicate a specific type of noodles, shaped as narrow curved tubes. A macaron is a small baked good based on a meringue mixed with a nut flour.

In standard culinary lingo, barm indicates a specific type of preferment, usually a stage in making sourdough. English hard wheat and German Hartweizen In English, there is a difference between durum wheat (glassy endosperm, used for noodles), hard wheat (used for bread flour) and soft wheat (low protein content, used for cake flour). In German, durum wheat is called Hartweizen (literally: hard wheat) and soft wheat is called Weichweizen (literally: soft wheat). Specialists know the American hard wheat as Manitobaweizen (literally: wheat from Manitoba), but it isn't imported, so it is very hard to meet somebody who has heard of it. English bread flour and German Brotmehl In English, bread flour is a flour with a low mineral and high protein content used for white yeast bread. It is made from hard wheat. In German, the term Brotmehl (literally: bread flour) isn't widely used, but if mentioned, is assumed to mean a flour mix suited for the average German bread, made from ca. 80% wheat flour with high mineral and moderate protein content, and 20% rye flour. It is made from soft wheat, with a high proportion of the bran milled in (but not enough to consider it whole wheat flour).
